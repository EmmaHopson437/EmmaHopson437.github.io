  <div id="about">About Me</div>
  
    <p class="info"> I like to believe that I am someone who empowers others. This past year I have been working to give students opportunities
    that will help them grow as a person and leader. I have created a National Scholarship Fund that helps students attend the Technology
    Student Association National Conference over the summer. I beleive that it is important to give back to the community which I am a part of.
    Throughout the the past year I have been working with several community service projects such as the Denver Peanut Butter Plan and Fleece for Fighters. 
    A big part of who I am comes from the leadership positions that I hold. They have helped me grow into a fierce, compassionate, motivated leader.
    If you have any question after reading through my resume please contact me through any of the contact information listed above.</p>

      <div>
        <p>
          I am a high school student at Arapahoe High School with a 4.0 GPA.
        </p>

    <h3 style="color:dodgerblue">Leadership</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I have held many different types of leadership positions. Many of them at the state level and 
          many of them at the school level too. My favorite organization to be a leader in is Technology Student Association.
        </p>
      </div>
      
    <h3 style="color:dodgerblue">Experience</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Because of my many leadership positions I have had the opportunity to experience the work world
          and be active in my community. Meeting people in the industry has helped me be more focused on
          what I want to do with my future and that is become an astronaut.
