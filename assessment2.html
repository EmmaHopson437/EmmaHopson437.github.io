      <p id="para1">This is a paragraph about random things. Random things are fun to talk about because you don't need to make any sense at all. <a href="http://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/" target="_blank">Paragraphs</a> are supposed to be 5 sentences long but I think that these are going to be shorter.</p>
		  
		  <p class="para2"><a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/search?query=touchpad&Products=LAPTOPS-AND-NETBOOKS/YOGA-SERIES/YOGA-3-PRO-1370-LAPTOP-LENOVO&searchLocation=PSPHome_S" target="_blank">Here</a>
 is an important link to show you how to fix a laptop mouse pad. I thought of this link because my mousepad doesn't work on my laptop. I have to use a mouse if I want to do anything. Well I guess that is a lie because it is a touch screen but that is very impractical.</p>
       
      <p id="para3">This is the last paragraph that I will be writing. There is not much content in this website so there is no <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/conclusions/" target="_blank">conclusion</a> that can be made. But in conlusion, thanks for reading all this random.</p>
