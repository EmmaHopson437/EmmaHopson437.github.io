   <p class= "regular">NASA currently has 44 astronauts. Of those 44, 14 of them are women. Astronauts have to go through a rigorous process to be picked. 
   They have to first be admitted into the astronaut candidate trianing program and then they are selected from there. Even if you don't get picked to be an 
   astronaut you are still almost guaranteed a position working for NASA. Here is a list of some of the active and former astronauts. </p>
