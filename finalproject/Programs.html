    <p class = "regular">NASA has been working very hard to create opportunities for people all over the US and of all different age groups. 
    I have compiled a list of some of the programs for high school students to higher education. This is a limited list and doesn't cover all of
    the programs that NASA offers. They have an even bigger range of programs for higher education students.</p>

          This is a competition that allows students to work on a team and create a science experiment that will be tested at a NASA microgravity drop tower facility. <br> <br>
          In order to become a team students must think of a scientific concept and write a proposal for an experiment and send it to NASA. All work should be done by the students, not the advisors.
