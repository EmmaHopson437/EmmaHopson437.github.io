            <li>April 11-17, 1970 <em>Apollo 13</em> had an oxygen tank rupture that caused several systems aboard to stop working. The astronauts on board had to return to earth in the landing module because the original craft
            was insufficient. This was a close call for NASA.</li>
            <li>July 26- August 7, 1971 NASA sent <em>Apollo 15</em> which had the first lunar rover and was able to extend their search. They broght back a piece from the ancient crust and called it the "Genesis Rock"</li>

            <li>March 3, 1972 <em>Pioneer 10</em> was launched into the solar system to get a better look at the gas giants</li>
            <li>July 23, 1972 <em>Landsat I</em> was launched which changed the way that people saw the earth. <em>Landsat I</em> gave information about vegetation and other land data</li>
            <li>July 15-24, 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was launched. Apollo-Soyuz was a joint project between the US and the Soviet Union. This opened up the idea of joint missions with the Soviet Union.</li>
            <li>August 20, 1975 <em>Viking I</em> was launed and sent to Mars. It landed on July 20, 1976.</li>

            hard time trying to recover from this horrible accident</li>
            <li>August 15, 1986 President Ronald Reagan announced that no more commercial sattelites would be launched unless they had national security in mind</li>

            <li>July 4, 1997 the <em>Mars Pathfinder</em> landed on Mars and collected 1.2 gigabits of information and sent over 10,000 photos of the Martian serface</li>
            <li>May 28, 1998 gave Earth the first image of a plant outside of the solar system. This planet was thought to have been flung outside of orbit from it's star.</li>
