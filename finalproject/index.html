    I created this page to because I want to know more about NASA and 
    the history, the programs and the future. Ever since I was in 5th 
    grade I have dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Every night I look 
    up at the sky and think about the endless possibilities waiting 
    beyond our planet. But it occurred to me that I can make this dream
    a reality with hard work and dedication. So I decided to find out 
    more about the administration that can make all my dreams come true.
